A basic `aiohttp`_ server which implement few endpoints. This project was made with educational purpose so those are some basic things.

About
-----
Here it's a `presentation`_ about what about what you can find in this repository.

Here it's a `documentation`_ made in postman.

Installation
------------
First you need some tools:
    1. A dependency manager: `Poetry`_.
    2. For presentation you will need `Postman`_ to perform requests.

Installation:
    1. Clone project locally;
    2. Install dependencies with ``poetry install``;
    3. Take a look at ``.example.env`` to see if you must configure something;
    4. Now run server with the following command: ``poetry run server``;

Postman Setup
-------------
    I assume you already have installed and setup postman locally; **Note** I recommend to create a new workspace to avoid overwriting existing things!

For **collection**: Open postman and from left upper corner select ``import`` and then ``Import from link`` and put this link: https://www.getpostman.com/collections/33c1efb9969544146bf9.

For **environment**: In this repository you will find a folder named ``docs``. Open postman select from left upper corner ``import`` and then ``Import folder`` and just drag and drop that folder.

For **globals**: From right upper corner click on that ``eye``, go with mouse on globals row and press edit, in that table add a new row with: Variable = username, Initial value = [your name], Current Value = [leave it blank], and press **save**.

    For ``local`` environment I suppose you will run your server on port ``8080`` and for ``qa`` on port ``8081``.
