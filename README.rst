Installation
------------
First you need some tools:
    1. A dependency manager: `Poetry`_.
    2. For presentation you will need `Postman`_ to perform requests.

Installation:
    1. Clone project locally;
    2. Install dependencies with ``poetry install``;
    3. Take a look at ``.example.env`` to see if you must configure something;
    4. Now run server with the following command: ``poetry run server``;
